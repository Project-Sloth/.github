Every single bit of contribution helps. If you'd like to spread the word about our project or, just want a nifty lookin' Chroma Sloth as your profile appearance; you are more than welcome to use our branding kit! This kit covers almost everything you could need when advertising/promoting with a full PSD of each piece of the branding broken down. You can make some pretty cool stuff :)

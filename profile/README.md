### Public Branding Kit
Every single bit of contribution helps. If you'd like to spread the word about our project or just want a nifty lookin' profile; you are more than welcome to use our public branding kit! This kit covers almost everything you could need when advertising/promoting with a full PSD of each piece of the branding broken down. (yes, Slothy is included in a few! He's our mascot after all!)
